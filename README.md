# color-codes
This was a Code Academy project to make a "cheat sheet" of CSS. I made one of all the color codes.
This was my first time using CSS Grid. 
Also note the way the tables start on the left and right sides, then move side-by-side on the bottom, and eventually conjoin into one table, as the browser window shrinks.
You can also copy any name or code from the tables by clicking on it.
