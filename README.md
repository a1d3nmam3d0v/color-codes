# css-colors
This was a Codecademy project to make a "cheat sheet" of CSS properties or concepts. I chose to make one for colors.
This was my first time using CSS Grid- note how the two tables start on the left and right sides, and as the browser window size decreases, the tables move to the bottom of the page and are side-by-side, then eventually they conjoin into one table.


To copy a name or code from the table just click on it.
