# css-colors
This was a Codecademy project to make a "cheat sheet" of any CSS property or concept. I chose to make one for colors.
This was my first time using CSS Grid- note how the two tables start on the left and right sides, then as the browser window size decreases, the tables move to the bottom of the page side-by-side, and eventually they conjoin into one table.


To copy a name or code from the table just click on it.
