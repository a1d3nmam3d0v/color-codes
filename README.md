# css-colors
This was a Code Academy project to make a CSS "cheat sheet". I chose to do mine on colors.
First time using CSS Grid- note how as the browser window decreases, the tables go from being on the left and right sides, to side-by-side on the bottom of the page, and eventually conjoin into one table.


To copy a name or code from the table just click on it.
